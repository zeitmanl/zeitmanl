Hello, my name is Lewis!
I’m a former bartender, psychologist, and current electrician!
I'm a recent recipient of a Computer Programming Degree and am actively looking for work.
My favorite languages are Java and Python but I'm also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and C++.
I'm currently planning on learning more about SQL and AWS.
I'm always interested in hearing about work opportunities, projects, and internships!
